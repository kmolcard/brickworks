 *  description {{{
 *    Just an empty header file that is always included at the beginning of
 *    [bw_common.h](bw_common).
 *
 *    Such inclusion is done with angle brackets (i.e.,
 *    `#include <bw_config.h>`), so you can "override" such file with a custom
 *    one you provide and appropriately set compiler include path order, or
 *    otherwise just modify it to your needs.
 *
 *    Its intended purpose is to allow you to `#include` needed files and
 *    `#define` values/macros that affect Brickworks modules
 *    (see [bw_common](bw_common)).
